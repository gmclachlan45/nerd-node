## Description
Our group has chosen to take on the second option for this class's Group Project (MyDiscussionForum Website).
We've collectively decided that this website will focus on the experiences of are currently taking/have taken Computer Science.
This discussion forum will be similar to Reddit in that users will primarily communicate through opening posts and comments.
Unlike Reddit, the discussion will solely be based around Computer Science, and adjacent topics such as
    - Algorithms
    - UI/UX Design
    - Hacking
    - Software

## User Types
The website will have 3 main kinds of users
- Guests -- unregistered users who can view but not participate in discussion
- Registered Users -- users who have registered via email, who can create and comment on posts
- Administrators -- super users who moderate and guide the discussion, and make the site a safe and fun place.

## Requirements
At a minimum, the website will have the following functionality
- All users will be able to view the website.
- Guests will be able to
    - view discussion posts
    - search for posts via search tags
    - have the option to register/login to an account
- Registered Users will be able to
    - do everything a guest is able to, like view and search for posts
    - create new posts
    - comment on existing posts (their own or other registered users)
    - edit comments and posts that they have already made
    - view their account and all of their posts
    - edit their username and other account settings (pronouns, favorite language maybe)
- Administrators will be able to
    - do everything the other two user types can
    - remove posts/comments that violate website guidelines
    - disable/ban users that repeatedly violate website guidelines
        - they will also be able to enable or unban users as they see fit
    - view any account and their posts

If time permits we will add the following functionality
- Registered Users and Administrators  can like and dislike comments and posts
- Visibility of posts change depending on a like/dislike ratio

Additional requirements may be added in the future depending on time and creativity
